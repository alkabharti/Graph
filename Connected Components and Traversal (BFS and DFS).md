## Connected components : 

A connected component or simply component of an undirected graph is a subgraph in which each pair of nodes is connected with each other via a path.

Because of different components in a graph we use the concept of visited array to traverse all nodes. 

```java
Vertex = 5
for node to Vertex(n)
  if (!visited[index])
    do traversal
```
