## Minimum Cost Path :
Given a square grid of size N, each cell of which contains integer cost which represents a cost to traverse through that cell, we need to find a path from top left cell to bottom right cell by which the total cost incurred is minimum.
From the cell (i,j) we can go (i,j-1), (i, j+1), (i-1, j), (i+1, j). 

Note: It is assumed that negative cost cycles do not exist in the input matrix.
